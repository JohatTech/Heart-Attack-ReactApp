# Heart Attack React Application

This is a web aplication to predict heart attack using a machine learning model base on input data from the users.This application is just for testing purpose, you should not make any medical decision base on the resutls in this apps, we always encourge users to confirm and check the prediction with a medical doctor.

The machine learning model is base on Support Vector Machine model, we compare this model wit two differents ones then I analyzing the performance with confusion matrix and other metrics to make a decision of what model use in this application.

The data asked to the users is specially select to facilite the users the predicition, at least 90% of the data that I ask can be response or measure just by the user, the goal here is to help the patient to get a quick diagnostic by himself if theres is not medical doctor available.

For the API development I use Flask library from Python. The front-end stack is build using Reactjs,
